## Problem Statement

Organizations responding to tenders and RFPs receive long, unstructured documents
that must be analyzed quickly to prepare compliant responses.

Key challenges include:
- Identifying scope of work and deliverables consistently
- Avoiding missed requirements hidden in large documents
- Maintaining a formal, neutral, government-appropriate tone
- Reducing manual effort and review time

Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency,
especially when multiple tenders must be handled in parallel.

## Why Use LLMs

Large Language Models can assist in analyzing large documents,
but naive prompts often produce:
- Overly generic summaries
- Assumptions not present in the document
- Inconsistent structure across outputs

This project focuses on designing a **structured prompt system**
that improves reliability, consistency, and usability of AI-generated
tender analysis outputs.

## Scope of This Project

- Analyze tender/RFP text
- Extract key response sections
- Produce structured, review-ready outputs
- Avoid assumptions or hallucinated information
